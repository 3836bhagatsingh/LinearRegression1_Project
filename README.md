My First Machine Learning on Linear Regression Algorithm.


In  this project repository Dataset is also there with some features


Input Features -> Hours Studied,Previous Scores,Extracurricular Activities,Sleep Hours,Sample Question Papers Practiced
Output features -> Performance Index



Steps:-
1- Load the dataset in model.ipynb file


2- Perform , Data encoding, train-test-split and feature Scaling sequentially 


3- Train the model with LinearRegression object


4- Pickle the file 


5- Create a UserInterface using Streamlit


6- Input data from user in all input fields


7- Perform , Data encoding, train-test-split and feature Scaling sequentially  on user input


8- pass the final data in prediction function where model will predict output


9- finally , show the result
